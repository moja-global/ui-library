## Introduction

[Moja global](http://moja.global/) is a collaboration under the [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org/) that aims for the widest possible collaboration on and use of credible tools to better manage the land sector. The flagship software is the [Full Lands Integration Tool (FLINT)](https://github.com/moja-global/flint), a tool to estimate emissions and sinks of greenhouse gasses from forestry and agriculture.

Moja global User-interface (UI) library aims to bring forward an intuitive, consistent, and easy-to-use interface that can help our developers within the User-Interface working group and users to quickly accomplish their tasks. The UI library aims to considerably improve our design & development workflow and meet the acceptable web accessibility requirements for our potential users. A UI library helps us mitigate popular UI-development issues like inconsistent user-experience, performance issues, accessibility requirements and more.
